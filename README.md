Hi! Thank you for attending my TED Talk. This is my LIRI Node app. A simply backend search engine to search Spotify Music, OMDB, and Bands in town (eventually)

If you've ever wanted information about some music or a band, look no further! You will have the opportunity to search information based on either a song title, album, or simply searching the artist!

What about movies? Have you wanted to get back quick and easy results on any particular movie you may be interested in! I still don't know why you'd look any further!

Is that all? What about looking for bands coming to town and finding their venues? Then you should look further. Because I haven't figured that one out. Someday you may not need to look further, but today... you probably should. Terribly sorry.

Getting the app to function is quite easy! Using inquirer prompts we allow the user to simply select options from a drop down.
From the start you get a drop down of whether you want to search Spotify, OMDB, and Live Bands!
Once selected you can refine your search! 

If you chose Spotify you'll get another drop down letting you choose either Band/Artist, Albums, or Songs!
After choosing one from the dropdown you can enter your own search! Typing in whatever you'd like to search!

With Movies, simply select it from the initial dropdown and start typing! Search to your hearts content! You'll get back a large list of all pertanent information you might ever want!

And bands in town doesnt work. BUT THAT DOESNT MEAN YOU CANT SELECT IT!
Select away weary traveler! 
It will even ask you what bands you'd like to search for!
Just don't be surprised by the response. I've told you it doesn't work yet from the start.
But try anyway whipper snapper! Curiosity doesn't have a high feline mortality rate or anything.

Oh! You need more!? What technologies did I use? 
I am terribly excited you asked!
I used node-spotify-api for all the delightful tunes you are so eagerly wanting to look up.
I used axios to make those incredibly important OMDB calls to retrieve that movie information you so desperately crave!
I used inquirer to create prompts and inputs for you, the sensational user, to have an ease of comfort while finding information!
I also brought in moment, dotenv, and bandsintown. But they have given no life to my beautiful creation!
They have failed me and I shall never forget this day! 

Anyway, thank you for reading all this! Happy searching my friend!
